  is your local guide(s) to a city

MVC based website application. #Local-ea stands for the type of a person who likes to enjoy his city and is willing to suggest to any visitors tips about his town. 

## The project

During Bootcamp 4 by AFDEmp the final project was about a messaging app interacting dynamically with a database. This app has all 3-tier architecture levels. 
The idea was to built an application where the users can loggin or sign up in order to find a Local-e User to ask for suggestions about the city(restaurants, bar, stores, landmarks, sightseeings, events etc.). The idea was to use a Google Map API interface, where the logged user(visitor to a city in need of directions of a local-e), can interact with the local-ea of every city.
The main functions:
 - [x] **Authenticating Users** (Visitor Views, Simple Logged User, Local-e User, Admin User and God User(made for project purposes))
 - [x] **Users can Login or Sign Up and Log Off**
 - [x] **Interact with the Map(Location Permission and Select Area to find Local-ea)**
 - [x] **Real-Time Messaging between Users(real-time notifications)**
 - [x] **Rate the Local-ea Users once you interact with them**
 - [x] **Calculating Top Ratings by searched area**
